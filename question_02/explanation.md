**Question 2a**: Would you be happy with these results or would you like to do more analysis.

Yes and no is my answer! While high accuracy on the validation set is a positive sign, it is important to conduct more analysis before drawing any final conclusions. 
Accuracy alone might not provide a comprehensive understanding of the model's performance. It is essential to evaluate other performance metrics 
and consider factors like class distribution, potential bias, and generalization to unseen data.




**Question 2b**: If so, what type of analysis would you perform?

Here are just a few of the different analyses I would perform in this specific situation: 

1. **Confusion Matrix**: Examine the confusion matrix to understand the distribution of true positives, 
true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. This will helps identify any class imbalances, potential bias, 
or specific areas where the model might be struggling.

2. **Precision, Recall, and F1 Score**: Calculate precision, recall, and F1 score to assess the model's performance on each class. 
These metrics provide insights into how well the classifier is performing in terms of correctly identifying real and fake images. 
By analyzing per-class metrics, you can identify potential issues and assess the balance between precision and recall.

3. **ROC Curve and AUC**: Plotting the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve and calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC) can provide a 
more comprehensive evaluation of the classifier's performance. The ROC curve illustrates the trade-off between true positive rate (sensitivity) 
and false positive rate (1-specificity) at various classification thresholds. AUC represents the overall performance of the classifier, 
with higher values indicating better discrimination ability.

4. **Cross-Validation**: Perform cross-validation to assess the model's robustness and generalization across different subsets of the data. 
This technique helps evaluate the stability of the model's performance and detect any potential overfitting or underfitting issues.

5. **Bias and Fairness Assessment**: Evaluate the classifier for potential biases or fairness issues, especially if the dataset or task is sensitive to such concerns. 
Analyze if the model exhibits differential performance across different demographic groups or if it amplifies existing biases in the data.

After these types of analyses are performed, I would feel comfortable that the classifier ACTUALLY reporting high accuracy! I think the confusion matrix will provide many insights to the data as well as performing 
cross-validation. Again, we should always be checking the biases in the data so double checking bias and fairness is necessary as well.
